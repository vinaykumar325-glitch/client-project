Bugs Found & Fixes

2. NoneType Subscript Bug

Bug: TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable when slicing document_text.

Fix: Added safe handling for None and non-string inputs.

3. Wrong Parameter Name

Bug: Used tool= instead of tools= when creating Agents.

Fix: Corrected to tools=.

4. File Handling Issues

Bug: PDF/Text reading failures crashed tasks.

Fix: Added robust PDFLoader with fallbacks.

5. Inefficient Prompts

Bug: Prompts instructed AI to "make up" or were vague.
